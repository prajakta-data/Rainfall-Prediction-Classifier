# Rainfall Prediction Classifier

This project builds a machine learning classifier to predict whether it will rain tomorrow using Australian weather data.  
It includes:

- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Pipeline creation
- Random Forest + Logistic Regression models
- GridSearchCV optimization
- Performance evaluation (TPR, accuracy, confusion matrix)

This notebook was completed as part of the IBM Machine Learning Final Project.
